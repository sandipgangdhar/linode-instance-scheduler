#
# Container image for the Linode Instance Scheduler (roadmap: LKE deployment option).
# This is an additional way to run the same code the VM deployment guide
# (docs/deployment-guide.md) already documents -- nothing about the application
# changes for this path; only how it's packaged and where its persistent state lives.
#
# Two-stage build:
#   1. "web-build"  -- Node, builds the React/Vite dashboard (web/dist/).
#   2. final        -- Python, installs the app's dependencies, then copies its Python files
#                       (individually -- not test files or other dev-only tooling this repo
#                       also carries) FLAT into /app, alongside web/dist copied from the
#                       build stage above. This flat, "web/dist is a direct sibling of the
#                       app's own .py files, and so is state/" layout is REQUIRED, not
#                       arbitrary -- it's exactly what the application's own code expects
#                       (api_server.py's own _WEB_DIST path, instance_manager.py's own
#                       REGISTRY_PATH) -- and it is the one thing this Dockerfile's own two
#                       COPY lines below must always preserve, however those source files are
#                       laid out in whichever copy of this repository you're building from.
#
# No credentials are baked in. LINODE_API_TOKEN and every other secret this tool uses are
# supplied at runtime as environment variables (see k8s/secret.example.yaml) -- never a
# build ARG, never written into an image layer.
#
# An official pre-built image is published automatically on every tagged release to
# ghcr.io/sandipgangdhar/linode-instance-scheduler (:latest and :vX.Y.Z), so building this
# yourself is a convenience, not a requirement -- see docs/deployment-guide-lke.md. Build it
# yourself instead if you want a different CPU architecture, want to build from a modified
# checkout, or would rather not trust a pre-built binary at all.
#
# Build from the repository root -- this Dockerfile's own COPY lines below are written
# relative to it and cannot be built from inside a subdirectory.
#
# ALWAYS pass --platform explicitly. A plain `docker build` with no --platform builds for
# the machine you're running it on, not the machine that will run the image -- on Apple
# Silicon (arm64) that silently produces an arm64 image that a real Linode LKE node (amd64)
# cannot run at all, with no error until the pod crash-loops in production. This is a
# documented, previously-hit mistake in the sibling Linode-LKE-Private-Network project's own
# build history; don't repeat it here.
#
# Single-arch (the common case -- almost every Linode compute plan, and therefore almost
# every LKE node, is amd64):
#
#   docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <registry>/linode-instance-scheduler:latest .
#
# Multi-arch (only if your cluster genuinely mixes amd64 and arm64 node pools -- needs
# `docker buildx create --use` once first, and a registry to push the manifest list to
# directly; buildx can't load a multi-platform result into the local `docker images` cache):
#
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
#     -t <registry>/linode-instance-scheduler:latest --push .
#
# The same image serves every long-running role this tool has (the scheduler/poller, the
# REST API + dashboard) -- which one a given container actually runs is decided entirely by
# the command/args Kubernetes passes it (see k8s/deployment.yaml), not by anything baked in
# here. Running the CLI for a one-off command (e.g. `onboard`, `rebuild`) against the same
# state is just `docker run <image> <subcommand> ...`, or `kubectl exec` into a running pod.
